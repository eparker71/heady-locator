# heady-locator

Displays a map and list of all the locations that sell the beer Heady Topper.
Locations are scraped from page http://alchemistbeer.com/buy/

Allows users to see how far away any location is by mapping the route from the users current location. The list is sorted by name, but it can be filtered by the delivery day which appears as a badge.

I created this project to get familiar with some new technologies. 

The project uses the following:

* Node package manager (npm)
* bower
* Gulp
* jshint
* Angular
* Google Maps
* Bootstrap
* python
* php

I use the php file as an easy way to create an api that angular can use. it's generated by the python script update_heady_locations.py. 

See the bower.json and package.json files for more info on the project dependencies. 

The code is a little rough at the moment, but it works, and should be relatively easy to install.

##How to Install?

You will need to have node installed before you start.
```
npm install 
node_modules/bower/bower install
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js build
```
